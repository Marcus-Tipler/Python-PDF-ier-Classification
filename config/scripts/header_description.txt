A command-line utility designed to remove duplicate files and ensure data redundancy. Originally developed to address issues at a Farm and 
Campsite near Loch Ness, where incorrect drivers were installed on newly upgraded laptops, this program utilizes pattern detection and 
manual oversight to eliminate duplicates and upload remaining files to an on-premise storage solution (TrueNAS Server).

**KEY FEATURES:**

* Removes duplicate files based on manual overlooking and pattern detection
* Ensures data redundancy by uploading remaining files to TrueNAS Server
* Utilizes command-line interface for easy usage
